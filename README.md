# Things I noticed


<b>The more downtown areas had more people using the bikes</b>  
	-This makes sense as most people who are going to go for long rides on a bike probably own one and don't need to rent  
	-The bikes are probably being used by people who either want to avoid traffic or want to avoid public transit  
	-It would be interesting to see the change from a pre-covid period and compare it to public transit usage data  

<b>There were many more 'casual' users than 'member' users</b>  
	-This would mean thta most people don't rely on Citi Bikes as a means of transpoprtation but use it more out of convenience  
	-I would like to do more analysis on percentage of rides from member/casual as what I went over was ride times  
	-It would also be interesting to see how many times people use their service before changing to becoming a member  

<b>The top 9 start stations and top 9 end stations were the same but after that things started changing</b>  
	-I would have to look at data about population density during certain hours of the day but I would assume that has a large part to play  
	-Even though the order below top 9 changed it was still fairly similar  

<b>Other</b>  
	-The most common end station was "South Waterfront Walkway - Sinatra Dr & 1 St"  
	-The station with the most ride time was a null value  
	-The most common end station chart has null with 0 counts  
	-Pretty sure the Null with 0 counts is just something to do with nulls just actually not being counted  
	-However, this would mean that most people don't trake their bikes back to stations and instead just ditch them once they get to their destinatiton  
	-There are no start stations listed as null however I don't know if thats similar to how there are no New York start points and they're just not added to this dataset or if you can't use the bikes unless they're connected to a station to begin with
